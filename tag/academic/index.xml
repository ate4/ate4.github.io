      <title>Scientific programming language</title>
      <link>https://example.com/post/scientific-programming-language/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As computers become more ubiquitous in physics research (and scientific research in general), the issue of which programming languages to use becomes more important. Factors which especially influence the importance of this question are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;the increasing complexity of the tasks being programmed;
the increasing complexity and diversity of the machines being programmed;
the increasing use of graphical visualization and interfacing to scientific programs; and
the increasing number of the programming languages available in which to program. 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This page attempts to provide some pointers to good programming languages and environments for scientific uses, based on my own experience with them and on comments from other people.
Fortran
Fortran is the language of the past in scientific computation, and one of the main languages of the present, as far as physics is concerned. Its main strengths at the moment are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;a huge body of well-debugged and working code available;
a large base of experience residing in &amp;quot;older&amp;quot; physicists (pretty much all of us over the age of thirty?);
ease of use. 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last point is perhaps the most important, as Fortran has a &amp;ldquo;model&amp;rdquo; of the computer which is simple enough that one does not have to be a professional (i.e., extensive training or self-education in computer science or programming) to produce a reasonable Fortran program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not to say that it is not possible to produce a bad Fortran program. It is quite easy, but that is true of pretty much every computer language to some degree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortran 90 extends fortran in several useful ways, and makes it a more modern programming language, while retaining full compatibility with Fortran-77 code. Two of the more interesting features are aggregrate data types (&amp;ldquo;structures&amp;rdquo;) and built-in operations on arrays and matrices. In my opinion, Fortran tends to lose big as projects get more complex. The support for reuse and encapsulation of code is fairly poor in Fortran, at least in Fortran-77. Fortran 90 has more support for this, but I have little experience with it. Also, most graphical-interface and visualization packages have no native Fortran support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some Fortran 90 proponents would like to see some of the &amp;ldquo;dangerous&amp;rdquo; elements of Fortran-77 removed from the language. I think this is a bad idea. Go here to read why I think so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C and C++
C is an interesting choice as a scientific language. It is extremely flexible and available on about every machine known to man. Also, one of the best C compilers (gcc) is available for free. Almost all visualization and user-interface packages support the C language. C is frequently taught as a first or second language in university computer-science departments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A long-standing gripe about C is that it produces slower code than does the equivalent Fortran. Nowadays, computer speeds are doubling every year or so, and C compilers don&amp;rsquo;t seem to be doing that bad compared to Fortran anymore (typical C code runs between 50 and 100% as fast as the equivalent Fortran, depending on the application). In light of this, I think it&amp;rsquo;s hard to discard C on the basis of the speed of the code it produces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s a good scientific programming language. The C language is fairly close to the hardware, and it is quite easy to make big mistakes in coding an application. These mistakes often don&amp;rsquo;t display themselves in small test cases, since they involve memory-management issues and the like. Also, programming large applications in C requires some degree of professionalism, meaning a fairly deep grasp of the language. As such, it is a bad language for mainstream scientific programming; typically only the creator of a program, or people with real expertise in computer programming, will be able to understand a large C application unless it is very carefully written.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe these comments also apply to C++ coding. The concerns about readability and professionalism apply perhaps even more strongly here than for &amp;ldquo;just C&amp;rdquo;. C++ has the advantage of being the most-popular object-oriented language, but it is also recognized as being a fairly cryptic one. Again, a certain degree of professionalism is necessary to program a C++ application which is understandable to others. Packages which automatically generate C++ code from user-specified pseudocode help alleviate the problem, but then we are faced with asking all users to use the same C++ generator, which is another problem of the same magnitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above two are the &amp;ldquo;traditional&amp;rdquo; choices. I now turn to newer languages which are less well known in the scientific community.
Python
Python is an object-oriented, extensible, interpreted language. It runs on essentially all Unix systems, as well as on DOS/Windows platforms and on the Mac. It is free and comes with complete source code. It is very easy to begin using Python &amp;mdash; at a simple level, it resembles Basic and can be used interactively in the same way as Basic. However, it supports object methods and &amp;ldquo;scales&amp;rdquo; nicely. Scaling indicates the relative difficulty of writing small vs. large applications. The object facilities help and encourage one to write an application in small pieces. These small pieces can be put together to make the big program, and the small pieces can also be used in other applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another advantage of Python is its extensibility. One can write an object library in C, C++, or native Python, which can then either be dynamically or statically linked with the main Python system and used in Python programs. One can use this to make a programmable application, such as a data-plotting package. One would add a package to the interpreter which contained commands to set up your plots and to actually plot the data. This Python+graphics interpreter can be given a different name, such as &amp;ldquo;pygraph&amp;rdquo;, and invoked as a command. The interpreter will process the graphics commands and perform them. However, at the same time you can use any other valid Python command as a command to this graphics program! Thus one graphics input file for this program could first compute the result and then manipulate and plot it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The leap from this to having Python+package systems such as data-analysis programs, or experiment-control programs, is fairly obvious. This can also solve to some extent the above-mentioned dilemma about the use of C++. A professional programmer can produce a well-defined library package with a well-defined interface in C++, and this can be included into the Python programs for use. As Python is quite readable in much the same was as is Fortran, a &amp;ldquo;normal person&amp;rdquo; (i.e. someone who is not a professional programmer) can use this library in his programs. Both the professionals, who want the power and efficiency of C or C++, as well as the group who must use the result and be able to read and understand the program, can be happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My experience with Python started when I used it simply as an interactive calculator application &amp;mdash; I had found the standard Unix calculator &amp;ldquo;bc&amp;rdquo; lacking. At some point, I programmed a four-vector object package in Python and used it to write some nuclear-reaction kinematics computations which I needed. I later in turn used both the four-vector and kinematics modules in a large application used to predict counting rates for a large nuclear-physics experiment. I have since then also written a multiparameter batch data-analysis facility in Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several graphical-interface tools exist for Python, and a graphical-visualization package is now in beta test. A Numerical Python extension (a C package as described above in the extensions section) also exists which has built-in support for whole-array and matrix operations (which run at the speed of compiled C code rather than at the speed of interpreted Python.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see what Python can do with this numerical-computing package, check out this link. It will also give you a feel for what Python looks like, and allow you to assess its readability. Also check out the Python Tutorial on the Python Web Page link below (sublink &amp;ldquo;The Full Scoop on Python Documentation.&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An article on Numerical Programming in Python appears in the May/June 1996 issue of Computers in Physics. More Python information can be found on the newsgroup comp.lang.python, or on the Python Web Page. Of particular interest is the page on contributed Python software, which describes add-on packages available for Python. These are extensions in the vein mentioned above, which add new functionality to the core language.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The content of the main elements of the report
is the title page.The first
list of work is formed according to the pattern, which is usually given in the manuals on your subject.It is not required
to specify such elements as the name of the educational institution, the type of work
and information about the performer, but also to arrange them in strict accordance with the standards
.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Abstract.The abstract is actually a brief presentation of your entire report and contains a number of statistical information. It should specify the number of parts, pages of the work, illustrations, appendices, tables, and used literature sources and applications. Here is also a list of the keywords of the work and the text of the abstract itself.The latter implies the main elements of the work from the set goals to the results and recommendations for their implementation.In the practice of universities, the abstract is usually not included in the reports on laboratory work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Introduction. In the introduction of a typical laboratory work, the goals of the research being conducted and the tasks that will help achieve the goals set are usually prescribed. At the same time, there are jobs in which students become real pioneers.Have you ever felt at least once a sense of extreme curiosity and impatience during laboratory work? To feel that in just a couple of minutes you will find the answer to the question to which there is no answer yet?The name for such an investigation will be written at the time of the return of the evidence of the actuality and the novelty of the study of the system.In order to really conduct research in this area, in which, as they say, no human foot has yet set foot, in the introduction you will need to give an assessment of modern the state of the problem under consideration and justify the need for its solution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The main part. Since different universities and disciplines have their own subtleties of laboratory work, the content of the main part is described in detail in the relevant manuals.It is important that this section of the work reflects its essence, describes the methodology and results of the work done. The main part prescribes the following elements:objectives of the study;tasks that will help you achieve your goals; the progress of the work, which describes the actions performed;  other sections provided by methodological materials on the discipline being studied.
– Conclusion.This part of the work needs to be done to get the results of the laboratory work.To do this, evaluate how fully the tasks have been completed.In complex works, other elements may also be present, for example, recommendations for further application of the results of the work carried out&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markdown is a markup language for texts. Such texts are easy to write and read. They can be easily converted to HTML. Most programmers prefer Markdown for writing documentation, describing their projects, writing blogs, and so on.
What does it mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &amp;ldquo;markup language&amp;rdquo; is just a set of conventions, rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s say you&amp;rsquo;re communicating with a friend by SMS. You can&amp;rsquo;t make the text bold or slanted in them. You agree with a friend: if I write * something* so between the asterisks, then consider it an oblique text. And if I write ** something ** between two asterisks, then consider it a bold text. You&amp;rsquo;ve made up the rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markdown is a set of similar rules.
The rules are clear to different programs and sites. For example, the &amp;ldquo;Questions and Answers&amp;rdquo; in Hexlet lessons support Markdown. This means that you can write texts there according to the Markdown rules, and after clicking &amp;ldquo;Send&amp;rdquo; the markup will become real: the text in single asterisks will become oblique, the text in double asterisks will become bold, and so on. This is a conversion from Markdown to HTML.
Why is this necessary?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;To add markup to places where real markup is not possible. For example, in a simple text file or in the same SMS, where it is impossible to highlight bold, create titles, highlight quotes, etc.
For more convenient writing of texts for subsequent conversion to HTML or other formats.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

      <title>it version control</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Version Control Systems (VCS) are used when several people work on one project.Usually, the main project tree is stored in a local
or remote repository, to which access is configured for project participants.When
making changes to the content of the project, the version control system allows
you to fix them, combine changes made by different project participants,
roll back to any earlier version of the project, if required.
In classical version control systems, a centralized model is used,
assuming a single repository for storing files.Most version control functions are performed by a special server.
The project participant (user)
receives the version of files he needs before starting work through certain commands.After making changes, the user
places the new version in the repository. At the same time, previous versions are not deleted
from the central repository and you can return to them at any time.The server may
not save the full version of the modified files, but produce a so-called
delta compression—save only changes between successive versions, which
reduces the amount of stored data Version control systems support the ability to track and resolve
conflicts that may arise when several people work on a single
file.You can merge (merge) the changes made by different participants (
automatically or manually), manually select the desired version, cancel the changes altogether
or lock the files for modification. Depending on the settings, the lock does not
allow other users to get a working copy or prevents the change
a working copy of the file by means of the OS file system, thus
providing privileged access to only one user working with the file.
Version control systems can also provide additional, more flexible
functionality.For example, they can support working with multiple versions of a single file, keeping a common history of changes up to the point of branching
versions and their own change histories of each branch.Moreover,
information is usually available about which of the participants, when and what changes were made.The usual
this kind of information is stored in the change log, access to which can be restricted.
Unlike the classical ones, in distributed version control systems, a central
repository is not mandatory.
Among the classic VCS, the most famous are CVS, Subversion, and among the distributed ones — Git, Bazaar, Mercurial. The principles of their work are similar, they differ mainly in the syntax of the commands used in the work&lt;/p&gt;
