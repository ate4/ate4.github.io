In classical version control systems, a centralized model is used, assuming a single repository for storing files.Most version control functions are performed by a special server. The project participant (user) receives the version of files he needs before starting work through certain commands.After making changes, the user places the new version in the repository. At the same time, previous versions are not deleted from the central repository and you can return to them at any time.The server may not save the full version of the modified files, but produce a so-called delta compression—save only changes between successive versions, which reduces the amount of stored data Version control systems support the ability to track and resolve conflicts that may arise when several people work on a single file.You can merge (merge) the changes made by different participants ( automatically or manually), manually select the desired version, cancel the changes altogether or lock the files for modification. Depending on the settings, the lock does not allow other users to get a working copy or prevents the change a working copy of the file by means of the OS file system, thus providing privileged access to only one user working with the file. Version control systems can also provide additional, more flexible functionality.For example, they can support working with multiple versions of a single file, keeping a common history of changes up to the point of branching versions and their own change histories of each branch.Moreover, information is usually available about which of the participants, when and what changes were made.The usual this kind of information is stored in the change log, access to which can be restricted. Unlike the classical ones, in distributed version control systems, a central repository is not mandatory. Among the classic VCS, the most famous are CVS, Subversion, and among the distributed ones — Git, Bazaar, Mercurial. The principles of their work are similar, they differ mainly in the syntax of the commands used in the work\n  The template is mobile first with a responsive design to ensure that your site looks stunning on every device.

Such texts are easy to write and read. They can be easily converted to HTML. Most programmers prefer Markdown for writing documentation, describing their projects, writing blogs, and so on. What does it mean?\nA “markup language” is just a set of conventions, rules.\nLet’s say you’re communicating with a friend by SMS. You can’t make the text bold or slanted in them. You agree with a friend: if I write * something* so between the asterisks, then consider it an oblique text. And if I write ** something ** between two asterisks, then consider it a bold text. You’ve made up the rules.\nMarkdown is a set of similar rules. The rules are clear to different programs and sites. For example, the “Questions and Answers” in Hexlet lessons support Markdown. This means that you can write texts there according to the Markdown rules, and after clicking “Send” the markup will become real: the text in single asterisks will become oblique, the text in double asterisks will become bold, and so on. This is a conversion from Markdown to HTML. Why is this necessary?\nTo add markup to places where real markup is not possible. For example, in a simple text file or in the same SMS, where it is impossible to highlight bold, create titles, highlight quotes, etc. For more convenient writing of texts for subsequent conversion to HTML or other formats.
