Factors which especially influence the importance of this question are\nthe increasing complexity of the tasks being programmed; the increasing complexity and diversity of the machines being programmed; the increasing use of graphical visualization and interfacing to scientific programs; and the increasing number of the programming languages available in which to program.  This page attempts to provide some pointers to good programming languages and environments for scientific uses, based on my own experience with them and on comments from other people. Fortran Fortran is the language of the past in scientific computation, and one of the main languages of the present, as far as physics is concerned. Its main strengths at the moment are\na huge body of well-debugged and working code available; a large base of experience residing in \u0026#34;older\u0026#34; physicists (pretty much all of us over the age of thirty?); ease of use.  The last point is perhaps the most important, as Fortran has a “model” of the computer which is simple enough that one does not have to be a professional (i.e., extensive training or self-education in computer science or programming) to produce a reasonable Fortran program.\nThis is not to say that it is not possible to produce a bad Fortran program. It is quite easy, but that is true of pretty much every computer language to some degree.\nFortran 90 extends fortran in several useful ways, and makes it a more modern programming language, while retaining full compatibility with Fortran-77 code. Two of the more interesting features are aggregrate data types (“structures”) and built-in operations on arrays and matrices. In my opinion, Fortran tends to lose big as projects get more complex. The support for reuse and encapsulation of code is fairly poor in Fortran, at least in Fortran-77. Fortran 90 has more support for this, but I have little experience with it. Also, most graphical-interface and visualization packages have no native Fortran support.\nSome Fortran 90 proponents would like to see some of the “dangerous” elements of Fortran-77 removed from the language. I think this is a bad idea. Go here to read why I think so.\nC and C++ C is an interesting choice as a scientific language. It is extremely flexible and available on about every machine known to man. Also, one of the best C compilers (gcc) is available for free. Almost all visualization and user-interface packages support the C language. C is frequently taught as a first or second language in university computer-science departments.\nA long-standing gripe about C is that it produces slower code than does the equivalent Fortran. Nowadays, computer speeds are doubling every year or so, and C compilers don’t seem to be doing that bad compared to Fortran anymore (typical C code runs between 50 and 100% as fast as the equivalent Fortran, depending on the application). In light of this, I think it’s hard to discard C on the basis of the speed of the code it produces.\nNevertheless, I don’t think it’s a good scientific programming language. The C language is fairly close to the hardware, and it is quite easy to make big mistakes in coding an application. These mistakes often don’t display themselves in small test cases, since they involve memory-management issues and the like. Also, programming large applications in C requires some degree of professionalism, meaning a fairly deep grasp of the language. As such, it is a bad language for mainstream scientific programming; typically only the creator of a program, or people with real expertise in computer programming, will be able to understand a large C application unless it is very carefully written.\nI believe these comments also apply to C++ coding. The concerns about readability and professionalism apply perhaps even more strongly here than for “just C”. C++ has the advantage of being the most-popular object-oriented language, but it is also recognized as being a fairly cryptic one. Again, a certain degree of professionalism is necessary to program a C++ application which is understandable to others. Packages which automatically generate C++ code from user-specified pseudocode help alleviate the problem, but then we are faced with asking all users to use the same C++ generator, which is another problem of the same magnitude.\nThe above two are the “traditional” choices. I now turn to newer languages which are less well known in the scientific community. Python Python is an object-oriented, extensible, interpreted language. It runs on essentially all Unix systems, as well as on DOS/Windows platforms and on the Mac. It is free and comes with complete source code. It is very easy to begin using Python — at a simple level, it resembles Basic and can be used interactively in the same way as Basic. However, it supports object methods and …","date":1653436800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1653436800,"objectID":"85a6a2206353c2db2c573e9cf746a3e6","permalink":"https://example.com/post/scientific-programming-language/","publishdate":"2022-05-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/scientific-programming-language/","section":"post","summary":"The design of the report.","tags":["Academic"],"title":"Scientific programming language","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Is surrounded by art every day. It’s hard to imagine a person’s life without art. It dates back to ancient times, when primitive people learned to draw on rocks, make tools, and make sounds.\nOver the years, the culture has changed. But unlike people who lived, lived their lives and died, she remained. There are works by leading composers: Bach, Mozart, Beethoven. They have passed through the years and continue to please many people. We may not know the authors of famous works, but we hear and see the creation itself. A person may not know that the Mona Lisa was written by Leonardo da Vinci, and “To Elise” by Beethoven, but these works are priceless. And all because feelings are connected in them. In any kind of art - painting, literature, music, theater - feelings are embedded. The author, drawing a portrait, adds something of his own - his feelings, thoughts. The viewer perceives everything in his own way as well.In any work of art, he sees his own, his inner world. So, for example, one book can make a movie, a TV series, show a performance, but it will all be different, because everyone has their own ideas.\nArt helps people discover more of themselves, realize themselves, go into their inner world - the world of their ideas and dreams. It helps to break away from the reality as it is, and get into a completely different, opposite world. That is why the role of art is invaluable in human life.\nThe task of man is to preserve art. Yes, you can restore later to do something new. But it will be different, not what it really was. We must appreciate and cherish what we have. If this does not happen, if people stop appreciating art, the world will be doomed to destruction.\n","date":1653436800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1653436800,"objectID":"9b74b6d80c74c11210b876d3c28bd186","permalink":"https://example.com/project/project1/","publishdate":"2022-05-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/project1/","section":"project","summary":"The importance of art in a person's life","tags":["Deep Learning"],"title":"The art","type":"project"},{"authors":["Mitichkina Kate"],"categories":["Demo"],"content":"Overview I decided to change something and started doing an individual project earlier and I hope to pass this time\n  The template is mobile first with a responsive design to ensure that your site looks stunning on every device.

Introduction. In the introduction of a typical laboratory work, the goals of the research being conducted and the tasks that will help achieve the goals set are usually prescribed. At the same time, there are jobs in which students become real pioneers.Have you ever felt at least once a sense of extreme curiosity and impatience during laboratory work? To feel that in just a couple of minutes you will find the answer to the question to which there is no answer yet?The name for such an investigation will be written at the time of the return of the evidence of the actuality and the novelty of the study of the system.In order to really conduct research in this area, in which, as they say, no human foot has yet set foot, in the introduction you will need to give an assessment of modern the state of the problem under consideration and justify the need for its solution The main part. Since different universities and disciplines have their own subtleties of laboratory work, the content of the main part is described in detail in the relevant manuals.It is important that this section of the work reflects its essence, describes the methodology and results of the work done.

Such texts are easy to write and read. They can be easily converted to HTML. Most programmers prefer Markdown for writing documentation, describing their projects, writing blogs, and so on. What does it mean?\nA “markup language” is just a set of conventions, rules.\nLet’s say you’re communicating with a friend by SMS. You can’t make the text bold or slanted in them. You agree with a friend: if I write * something* so between the asterisks, then consider it an oblique text. And if I write ** something ** between two asterisks, then consider it a bold text. You’ve made up the rules.\nMarkdown is a set of similar rules. The rules are clear to different programs and sites. For example, the “Questions and Answers” in Hexlet lessons support Markdown. This means that you can write texts there according to the Markdown rules, and after clicking “Send” the markup will become real: the text in single asterisks will become oblique, the text in double asterisks will become bold, and so on. This is a conversion from Markdown to HTML. Why is this necessary?\nTo add markup to places where real markup is not possible. For example, in a simple text file or in the same SMS, where it is impossible to highlight bold, create titles, highlight quotes, etc. For more convenient writing of texts for subsequent conversion to HTML or other formats.

In classical version control systems, a centralized model is used, assuming a single repository for storing files.Most version control functions are performed by a special server. The project participant (user) receives the version of files he needs before starting work through certain commands.After making changes, the user places the new version in the repository. At the same time, previous versions are not deleted from the central repository and you can return to them at any time.The server may not save the full version of the modified files, but produce a so-called delta compression—save only changes between successive versions, which reduces the amount of stored data Version control systems support the ability to track and resolve conflicts that may arise when several people work on a single file.You can merge (merge) the changes made by different participants ( automatically or manually), manually select the desired version, cancel the changes altogether or lock the files for modification. Depending on the settings, the lock does not allow other users to get a working copy or prevents the change a working copy of the file by means of the OS file system, thus providing privileged access to only one user working with the file. Version control systems can also provide additional, more flexible functionality.For example, they can support working with multiple versions of a single file, keeping a common history of changes up to the point of branching versions and their own change histories of each branch.Moreover, information is usually available about which of the participants, when and what changes were made.The usual this kind of information is stored in the change log, access to which can be restricted. Unlike the classical ones, in distributed version control systems, a central repository is not mandatory. Among the classic VCS, the most famous are CVS, Subversion, and among the distributed ones — Git, Bazaar, Mercurial. The principles of their work are similar, they differ mainly in the syntax of the commands used in the work\n  The template is mobile first with a responsive design to ensure that your site looks stunning on every device.
