&lt;p&gt;Version Control Systems (VCS) are used when several people work on one project.Usually, the main project tree is stored in a local
or remote repository, to which access is configured for project participants.When
making changes to the content of the project, the version control system allows
you to fix them, combine changes made by different project participants,
roll back to any earlier version of the project, if required.
In classical version control systems, a centralized model is used,
assuming a single repository for storing files.Most version control functions are performed by a special server.
The project participant (user)
receives the version of files he needs before starting work through certain commands.After making changes, the user
places the new version in the repository. At the same time, previous versions are not deleted
from the central repository and you can return to them at any time.The server may
not save the full version of the modified files, but produce a so-called
delta compression—save only changes between successive versions, which
reduces the amount of stored data Version control systems support the ability to track and resolve
conflicts that may arise when several people work on a single
file.You can merge (merge) the changes made by different participants (
automatically or manually), manually select the desired version, cancel the changes altogether
or lock the files for modification. Depending on the settings, the lock does not
allow other users to get a working copy or prevents the change
a working copy of the file by means of the OS file system, thus
providing privileged access to only one user working with the file.
Version control systems can also provide additional, more flexible
functionality.For example, they can support working with multiple versions of a single file, keeping a common history of changes up to the point of branching
versions and their own change histories of each branch.Moreover,
information is usually available about which of the participants, when and what changes were made.The usual
this kind of information is stored in the change log, access to which can be restricted.
Unlike the classical ones, in distributed version control systems, a central
repository is not mandatory.
Among the classic VCS, the most famous are CVS, Subversion, and among the distributed ones — Git, Bazaar, Mercurial. The principles of their work are similar, they differ mainly in the syntax of the commands used in the work&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Markdown</title>

&lt;p&gt;Markdown is a markup language for texts. Such texts are easy to write and read. They can be easily converted to HTML. Most programmers prefer Markdown for writing documentation, describing their projects, writing blogs, and so on.
What does it mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &amp;ldquo;markup language&amp;rdquo; is just a set of conventions, rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s say you&amp;rsquo;re communicating with a friend by SMS. You can&amp;rsquo;t make the text bold or slanted in them. You agree with a friend: if I write * something* so between the asterisks, then consider it an oblique text. And if I write ** something ** between two asterisks, then consider it a bold text. You&amp;rsquo;ve made up the rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markdown is a set of similar rules.
The rules are clear to different programs and sites. For example, the &amp;ldquo;Questions and Answers&amp;rdquo; in Hexlet lessons support Markdown. This means that you can write texts there according to the Markdown rules, and after clicking &amp;ldquo;Send&amp;rdquo; the markup will become real: the text in single asterisks will become oblique, the text in double asterisks will become bold, and so on. This is a conversion from Markdown to HTML.
Why is this necessary?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;To add markup to places where real markup is not possible. For example, in a simple text file or in the same SMS, where it is impossible to highlight bold, create titles, highlight quotes, etc.
For more convenient writing of texts for subsequent conversion to HTML or other formats.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
